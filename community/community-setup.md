# Community Setup
This document describes a concept to setup a community efficiently.

## Collecting Potential Approaches
Inviting a friend and successful open source contributor can be done in the following way.
1. Ask the invitee to raise a PR adding his GitHub User and one of his public wallet addresses to [this file](https://github.com/cla-assistant/contributor-assistant/blob/main/community/invitation-tree.json)
2. Transfer an amount of coins from your wallet to the invitee. You can choose this amount depending on how high you value his recent contributions to the Open Source Community.
3. As soon as the amount is transferred and as soon everything is ready the PR (see step 1) can be merged
