      # Contributor Document

      This document defines the basics on how people can cooperate with me in general.

      ## Open Source

      I'm a fan of Open Source Software as it accelerates the overall progress in my opinion.  
      If you contribute to one of my repositories this means that you do not have any monetary / licensing or whatever claims out of those contributions. 
      I claim the right to use whatever license I want for my repositories (e.g. GNU AGPL...).

      ## Freedom

      I claim the right to change my repositories in whatever way I like as time goes by. If a contributor wants to develop things into a different direction than I, the corresponding contributor can do this in his own repository. 

      ## Fairness

      Each contributor should have the best of intentions when it comes to fairness and mutual support.
